# Move Specific Vulnerabilities
This doc is simply here to help aggregate all the right places to look for already found bugs. If you want to learn more about discovered bugs during audits/bug bounties, get inspired for your audit, or protect your protocol from them, this is for you.

**Disclaimer:** You will not find reports here. However, you will be able to find any sort of report using this doc. Think of it as an entry point, aggregating all the best resources for move vulnerabilities. 

## 1. MoveMaverick's Vulnerabilities Database
Hands down, the absolute best place to read all the already found bugs in Move. MoveMaverick is a Move security researcher and has chosen to help other researchers to easily find Move bugs. 

You could go to the repo or the md book (the latter is easier for reading). Maverick has done an amazing job of separating the different bugs to their classes and severities.
